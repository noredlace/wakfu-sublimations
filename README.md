# Wakfu Sublimations

This was originally a site I used to see what Sublis I could use for a particular Item.

Rewrote from Angular to React via Vibe Coding

## 🎮 What are Sublimations?

Sublimations are special abilities in Wakfu that can be applied to equipment. Each sublimation has:
- **3 Socket Colors**: Red (R), Blue (B), Green (G)
- **3 Tiers**: Progressive power levels with increasing effects
- **Maximum Level**: The highest level the sublimation can reach
- **Source**: Where/how to obtain the sublimation
- **Patch Information**: When the sublimation was introduced
